## Run the Script

python task-2.py

## Features

**Key-based Encryption:** Implement encryption and decryption methods that use a user-provided key. This allows for more secure encryption by using a variable key instead of a fixed value.

**Different Encryption Algorithms:** Explore and implement different encryption algorithms, such as symmetric key algorithms (e.g., AES) or asymmetric key algorithms (e.g., RSA), to provide stronger encryption and decryption capabilities.

**File Format Support:** Extend the tool to support encryption and decryption of various image file formats, such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, etc.
